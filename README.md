# Lab3 Explanation

The script I wrote creates a report from the FDNY response time report.
Specifically it produces the how many false alarms are reported each month citywide, providing the date and number of reports.

running this script is simple, just clone this repository and enter 'make' into the command line. The makefile runs a few shell scripts to first
download the data and then retrieve the desired information.
